Harriet,

With regards to the site handling a large volume increase of traffic, we are planning to have ZeroLag stress test the site for us soon. Based on the results of this test, we will try as best we can to optimize the site. One thing that would be very helpful for us would be if you could let us know when Shark Tank is scheduled to take place and/or possibly air. This will help us with scheduling with ZeroLag and help us plan for enough development time to fix any potential issues. 

To address the attached audit, unfortunately most of the things that were included we (i.e. Grapefruit) do not control. The content and SEO tags were generated by Gina at Social KNX
